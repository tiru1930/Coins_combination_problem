# Coins_combination_problem

Assume that in India, the currency is made up of coins only, and there are five coins in general circulation:

 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p .

 For example, It is possible to make Rs 3 in the following way:

5x2p + 8x5p + 2x10p + 4x20p + 3x50p = 3 Rupees .

or it could be 

0x2p + 0x5p + 0x10p + 0x20p + 6x50p = 3 Rupees .

or it could be 

150x2p + 0x5p + 0x10p + 0x20p + 0x50p = 3 Rupees .

there are 100s of combinations like this. 


Write all the combinations  Rs 3 be made . Write an efficient C/C++ program for this and send us the github link

How many combinations use less than 3 coins ?
